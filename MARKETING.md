# 30-Day Launch Content Calendar

## WEEK 1 — TEASE & LAUNCH

### Day 1 (Monday) — Teaser
**Platform:** Twitter/X + Instagram
**Post:**
Something I wish I had during training — a direct line to an attending who'd answer anything. Not just clinical questions. The career stuff. The money stuff. The "is this worth it?" stuff.

Building something for that. More soon.

### Day 2 (Tuesday) — Value Post
**Platform:** Twitter/X
**Post:**
Unpopular opinion: The biggest mistake cardiology fellows make isn't clinical.

It's signing their first attending contract without a lawyer.

I've seen colleagues leave $200K+ on the table because they didn't negotiate. A $2-3K attorney fee is the best investment you'll ever make.

Thread 🧵👇

1/ Your base salary is just the starting point. Look at the production model — are you salary only, or salary + RVU bonus?
2/ For interventional cardiology, $45-65/RVU is typical. Know your number before you walk in.
3/ Call requirements matter more than you think. 1:3 vs 1:5 is a lifestyle difference.
4/ Partnership track: get the timeline in writing. "We'll discuss it later" = never.
5/ Benefits to negotiate beyond salary: signing bonus, relocation, CME allowance, retirement match, tail coverage.
6/ The attending across the table negotiated their contract. You should too.

### Day 3 (Wednesday) — Personal Story
**Platform:** Instagram (Reel script — 60 sec)
**Script:**
"When I was a cardiology fellow, I had no one to ask about the business side of medicine. How much should I get paid? How do I read a contract? Is private practice better than academic? I figured it out the hard way. That's why I built HeartWise — so you don't have to."

### Day 4 (Thursday) — Launch Day 🚀
**Platform:** ALL (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit)

**Twitter/X:**
HeartWise is live. 🫀

A mentorship app where med students, residents, and cardiology fellows can ask me anything — clinical cases, fellowship apps, contract negotiation, finances, burnout, all of it.

Free to ask. I answer daily.

[link]

#HeartWise #MedTwitter #CardiologyMentorship

**LinkedIn:**
I'm excited to launch HeartWise — a mentorship platform for medical trainees interested in cardiology.

As an interventional cardiologist who trained at Weill Cornell and served as Chief Fellow twice, I remember how hard it was to find honest, practical guidance during training. Not just about medicine — but about career strategy, financial planning, and navigating the transition from fellow to attending.

HeartWise gives students, residents, and fellows a direct line to ask questions about:
• Clinical decision-making
• Fellowship applications and match strategy
• Contract negotiation and compensation
• Work-life balance and burnout
• Financial planning for physicians

Free tier available. I answer questions daily.

If you know a trainee who could benefit, please share.

**Reddit (r/medicalschool, r/Residency, r/cardiology):**
Title: Built a free mentorship app for anyone interested in cardiology — AMA

Post: Hey everyone. I'm an interventional cardiologist (Weill Cornell → Jefferson) and I built HeartWise because I wish something like it existed when I was training.

It's a Q&A platform where you can ask me anything — clinical, career, fellowship apps, finances, contracts, burnout. I answer daily.

Free tier: ask questions, browse answers
Premium ($25/mo): guaranteed 48h response, monthly live Q&A
VIP ($175/mo): 1-on-1 mentorship, CV review, mock interviews

No catch. I just want to help people coming up behind me navigate this path.

Happy to answer questions here too.

### Day 5 (Friday) — Q&A Highlight
**Platform:** Twitter/X + Instagram Story
**Post:**
First question on HeartWise:

"How competitive is interventional cardiology fellowship?"

My answer: Very. But here's exactly what to focus on 👇

[Screenshot of the Q&A from the app]

This is what HeartWise is about — real answers to real questions. Link in bio.

### Day 6-7 (Weekend) — Rest / engage with comments

## WEEK 2 — EDUCATE & BUILD TRUST

### Day 8 (Monday) — Clinical Pearl
**Post:**
The 3 ECG findings that tell me a patient needs the cath lab right now:

1. ST elevation in contiguous leads (obvious, but often missed in subtle presentations)
2. New LBBB with chest pain — treat as STEMI until proven otherwise
3. De Winter T-waves — the STEMI equivalent that doesn't get enough respect

What would you add?

### Day 9 (Tuesday) — Career Advice
**Post:**
How to stand out on cardiology fellowship applications:

- Letters > publications (a strong letter from your cardiology PD is gold)
- Quality > quantity for research (2 good first-author papers > 8 middle-author papers)
- Present at ACC or AHA (even a poster counts)
- Show genuine cath lab interest during residency
- Have a story for why interventional — not just "I like procedures"

Questions? Ask me on HeartWise — link in bio.

### Day 10 (Wednesday) — Finance Post
**Post:**
What I wish someone told me about money during fellowship:

- Start a Roth IRA immediately (your tax bracket will never be this low again)
- Disability insurance NOW while you're healthy and it's cheap
- Don't buy the dream car when you become an attending. Drive the fellowship car one more year.
- Understand your student loan repayment options — PSLF if academic, refinance if private practice

### Day 11 (Thursday) — App Feature Highlight
**Post:**
One thing I love about HeartWise: anonymous questions.

Fellows ask me about burnout. Students ask if they're good enough. Residents ask about imposter syndrome.

They wouldn't ask these in person. But they need answers.

That's why the anonymous option exists.
