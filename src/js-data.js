ai:{diag:'You are asking about one of the most competitive procedural fellowships in medicine. IC acceptance rates hover around 60-70% of cardiology fellows who apply, but top programs are significantly more selective.',
bottleneck:'The real bottleneck is not board scores\u2014it is differentiation. Most applicants have similar credentials. What separates winners is a clear procedural identity and relationships with interventional cardiologists who vouch for your hands and judgment.',

ai:{diag:'This is one of the highest-leverage financial decisions of your career. The $170K annual gap seems obvious, but PSLF, tax implications, and career trajectory make the analysis more nuanced.',
